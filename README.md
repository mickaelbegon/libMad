# libMad
`libMad` is a metapackage used to compile a shared library which contains a c interface for MadNLP.
It is currently _very much_ a work in progress.

## Current known issues and their workarounds:
As it currently stands we require several environment variables to be set when using libMad, to handle several issues coming from upstream Julia packages. 

### General
The following are necessary for any interface:

1. `JULIA_CUDA_USE_COMPAT="false"` This is necessary to make sure that `CUDA_Driver_jll` does not attempt to fork a second julia process which fails as the binary does not exist.
2. `JULIA_CUDSS_LIBRARY_PATH="path/to/cudss/lib"` This may be necessary if the `CUDA_Runtime_Discovery` package cannot find the cuDSS libraries.

### PARDISO MKL

The x86-64 build includes `MadNLPPardiso.PardisoMKLSolver`. Select it through
the C option interface with:

```c
libmad_set_string_option(opts_ptr, "linear_solver", "PardisoMKLSolver");
```

The backend is not enabled on ARM platforms because Intel oneMKL does not
provide a native ARM implementation. Set `MKL_NUM_THREADS` or
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` explicitly when benchmarking to avoid accidental
oversubscription.

This PARDISO MKL runtime variant intentionally does not depend on
`HSL`/`MadNLPHSL`, so it can be built without private HSL package credentials.
MA57 should be distributed as a separate HSL-enabled runtime subject to the
HSL licence.

And then several language specific issues may occur if the shared library is loaded through, e.g., the CasADi interface for python or Matlab:

### Python
If using the library through a python interface it may be necessary to set the following preload:

1. `LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libmad/bundle/julia/libssl.so"` This is necessary as python may load a different version of `libssl` than the one that `libMad` was compiled against. This leads to a failure during dynamic loading and a crash.

### Matlab
If using the library through a matlab interface it is necessary to set the following preload:

1. `LD_PRELOAD="/path/to/libmad/bundle/julia/libunwind.so"` This is necessary because Matlab ships it's own modified version of `libunwind` which causes segfaults during backtrace generation in `libMad`. **Be warned that this breaks the Matlab debugger, causing hard-crashes when attempting to open the debugger.**

## Current development
Requires `Julia 1.12+` and the [`JuliaC.jl` package](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaC.jl).
The `JuliaC.jl` app should be installed and a work around for [JuliacLang/JuliaC.jl#13](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaC.jl/issues/13) implemented, i.e., add `:$JULIA_LOAD_PATH` to the shim where the `JULIA_LOAD_PATH` is loaded.
Checks for these requirements are not currently failing the cmake.
To build:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
Which makes the library as well as a basic executable.
